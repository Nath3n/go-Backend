Hello! Thank you for taking the time to view my project.
In this project, I built a fully functional backend server in Go that processes requests and manages user information using CRUD operations.
I also set up API endpoints to interact with the server, and a local server to handle and respond to these requests.
The connection between the client and server has been tested to ensure proper functionality. This project demonstrates my ability to work with backend development, HTTP servers, and JSON-based APIs.
